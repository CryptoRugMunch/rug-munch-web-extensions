# Privacy Policy — Rug Munch Intelligence

**Last updated:** February 12, 2026

## Overview
Rug Munch Intelligence ("the Extension") is a browser extension that analyzes cryptocurrency tokens for potential scam indicators. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## Data We Collect

### Token Data
When you scan a token, we send the token's contract address to our analysis servers. This is publicly available blockchain data, not personal information.

### Account Data (Optional)
If you choose to create an account or link a Telegram account:
- Telegram user ID (for account linking)
- Wallet public addresses (for portfolio features)
- Scan history (tokens you've analyzed)

### Analytics (Minimal)
- Extension events (scans performed, features used) — no personal identifiers
- Error logs for debugging

## Data We Do NOT Collect
- Private keys or seed phrases — never, under any circumstances
- Browsing history beyond supported crypto sites
- Personal identity information (name, email, phone)
- Financial data or transaction amounts
- Data from non-crypto websites

## How We Use Data
- Token analysis and risk scoring
- Improving scan accuracy
- Account features (portfolio, reputation, alerts)

## Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties. Token analysis is performed on our own servers.

## Data Storage
- Scan results are cached to improve performance
- Account data is stored in encrypted databases
- You can request data deletion by contacting us

## Third-Party Services
- Helius (Solana RPC provider) — receives token addresses for blockchain queries
- DexScreener — receives token addresses for market data
- No advertising or tracking SDKs

## Your Rights
- Access your data via the extension's account settings
- Delete your account and all associated data
